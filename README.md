Crayne
======
Crayne is a desktop application which, given a ship manifest, decides the fastest ways to unload cargo using A*.
Crayne is the AI senior design written by Asa Merrigan, Nicholas Glasser, and Gabriel Limon. Crayne runs on [TideSDK](http://www.tidesdk.org/) which allowed us to write HTML5, CSS3, JS, and Python code as a desktop app.
